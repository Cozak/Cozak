    <content type="text"><![CDATA[文本It’s very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even link to Google! 强调This text will be italicThis will also be italicThis text will be boldThis will also be boldYou can combine them 删除线Any word wrapped with two tildes (like this) will appear crossed out. 标题段落Structured documentsSometimes it’s useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a # to create headings. Multiple ## in a row denote smaller heading sizes. This is a third-tier headingYou can use one # all the way up to ###### six for different heading sizes. If you’d like to quote someone, use the &gt; character before the line: Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised… I beat the Borg with it. Captain Janeway This is an &lt;h1&gt; tagThis is an &lt;h2&gt; tagThis is an &lt;h6&gt; tag列表Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit! Alternatively, Dashes work just as well And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star: Like this And this 无序列表 Item 1 Item 2 Item 2a Item 2b 有序列表 Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 3a Item 3b 块结构As Kanye West said: We’re living the future sothe present is our past. 资源链接If you want to embed images, this is how you do it: 图像 超链接GitHub 自动识别链接http://github.com - automatic! 代码There are many different ways to style code with GitHub’s markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: var example = true. If you’ve got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces: if (isAwesome){ return true } GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation: 123if (isAwesome)&#123; return true&#125; And if you’d like to use syntax highlighting, include the language: 123if (isAwesome)&#123; return true&#125; 行内代码I think you should use an &lt;addr&gt; element here instead. 代码高亮语法高亮12345function fancyAlert(arg) &#123; if(arg) &#123; $.facebox(&#123;div:'#foo'&#125;) &#125;&#125; 代码高亮function fancyAlert(arg) { if(arg) { $.facebox({div:&apos;#foo&apos;}) } } 无高亮（普通文本）def foo(): if not bar: return True 附加GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath — love your sweater! But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite: This is a complete item This is an incomplete item When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too! And, of course emoji! :sparkles: :camel: :boom: 任务列表 @mentions, #refs, links, formatting, and tags supported list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported) this is a complete item this is an incomplete item 表格You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |: First Header Second Header Content from cell 1 Content from cell 2 Content in the first column Content in the second column Hash索引值(仅Git有效)Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub. 16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6acmojombo@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6acmojombo/github-flavored-markdown@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac 议题引用(仅Git有效)Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link. #1mojombo#1mojombo/github-flavored-markdown#1 用户提及 @(仅Git有效)You can also @mention teams within an organization. 颜文字Emoji(仅Git有效)GitHub supports emoji! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:]]></content>
